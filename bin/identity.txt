# Insight Transform File V1.0
# Transform 0
# Transform: AffineTransform_double_3_3
# Parameters: a b c d e f g h i o p q
# FixedParameters: 0 0
# The “o p q” are the “offset”, which actually is not given in the file.
# The offset is computed from the 3×3 matrix (the first 9 parameters),
# from the translation “l m n” (the last three parameters),
# and from the center “x y z” (the three fixed parameters).
#
# To see how this is done, look at the code for ComputeOffset() itkMatrixOffsetTransformBase.hxx.
