### Current Tasks

#### Look at overlap in warped images from Russ Poldrack’s group – are they better than ours?

Data downloaded from BIDS example data directory
/gandg/bkraft/data/bids_ds001


#### If yes, then look at overlap in warped images from previous processing streams we have tried on INFINITE


#### Consider: looking at overlap of warped images in HFpEF to see if
problem is unique to INFINITE

#### Compare HFpEF with TopUp and distortion correction

* Added various markdown files for documentation
    * fmriprep
    * ants_cortical_thickness (ACT)
    * Creating singularity containers from Docker Images
