A standard way of organizing our code will go a long way toward helping make collaboration go smoothly.  The plan laid out here is based on:

    [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/) (Links to an external site.)

First, some terminology, going from lowest to highest level:

Module: a .py file that is designed to be imported.  It should be on the sys.path or be in the current directory, so it can be found by an import statement.

Package: a directory that contains modules along with an associated __init__.py file

Project: the top level directory containing your package(s), documentation, testing, etc.  This is what will be placed in the Github repository.

Here is the layout of the files for a project, using our tic_redcap_link project as an example:


.. code-block

    tic_redcap_link/  [ the Project ]
    .git/ [contains all the git auto-generated files]
    .idea/ [generated by PyCharm]
    __pycache__/ [also generated by PyCharm]
    .gitignore [tells git which files to ignore]
    README.rst
    LICENSE.txt
    setup.py [can be used to ensure dependencies (other packages) get installed]
    requirements.txt [ used by pip when installing the Package - alternative to setup.py]
    redcap_link/ [ the Package ]
        __init__.py
        redcap_upload.py [ a Module ]
        redcap_check.py [ another Module ]
        get_api_key.py [ another Module ]
        upcap.ini [ a config file used by modules ]
    docs/ [ create this directory, then use Sphinx to populate it.
                 See HOWTO: use Sphinx in PyCharm ]
        Makefile
        source/
        build/
    tests/
        mt.json  [ some test data for uploading to Redcap ]
        test_basic.py
        test_advanced.py
    dist/                        [ created by 'python setup.py sdist' ]
        redcap_link-1.0.0.tar.gz [   tarball for distribution - see   ]
                                 [  HOWTO: distribute Python packages ]


Contents of .gitignore:

.. code-block
    .idea/
    .DS_Store
    __pycache__/



Contents of __init__.py:

.. code-block
    from redcap_link.redcap_upload import redcap_upload
    from redcap_link.redcap_check import redcap_check


(you are importing functions [redcap_upload] from files [redcap_upload.py])
Importing from this project

Once you have the project all setup, with its package, here is how to use it in another python program:

.. code-block
    import redcap_link

    redcap_link.redcap_upload(...)
