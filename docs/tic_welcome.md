# TIC Welcome

## Introduction

The Imaging Collective is a group of independent NeuroImaging
researchers who are willing to share their knowledge, expertise, and
software for analyzing their data. Our goal is to make processing data
faster, easier, and with a broader set of tools among our members then
individuals could do on their own.


Software created by individual investigators is intended to be
open-source and shared with TIC. Most of the software developed by TIC
is intended to make processing neuroimaging data easier and use common
tools. These are the tools we are asking people to share.

**Sharing software tools is completely voluntary.** Investigators may
develop their own proprietary tools as part of their own research. We
hope these tools will be shared through collaborations but investigators
are not obligated to share these toosl.

TIC has adopted the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for easy
collaboration. BIDS provides a common directory structure storing
NeuroImaging data. Along with the data the BIDS structure contains JSON
files which contain additional information about the neuroimaging data,
which may be used as a quick reference.

BIDS has encouraged investigators to create BIDS Apps. These apps
provide a convenient and easy way for investigators to process their
data. TIC relies heavily on these Apps to do their processing. Each App
has their own little quirks. By identifying these quirks and sharing our
experience with how to run the software TIC members can get more down
with less effort.
