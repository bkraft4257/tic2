# TIC Welcome

## Introduction

The Imaging Collective is a group of independent NeuroImaging
researchers who are willing to share their knowledge, expertise, and
software for analyzing their data. Our goal is to make processing data
faster, easier, and with a broader set of tools among our members then
individuals could do on their own.

There is currently a torrent of open-source packages for processing
neuroimaging data. This makes it difficult for any single investigator
to keep up with all the software packages. Many of these open source
packages enable users to do sophisticated analyses with minimal setup
and effort. However, each package still has it's idiosyncrasies and
quirks. Sharing these quirks among TIC members in the form of
documentation, wrapper functions, and test code benefits all of us.

TIC members agree that sharing our knowledge and software is essential
for processing our data faster and easier. Software created by
individual investigators is intended to be open-source and shared with
TIC members. Most of the software developed by TIC members is expected
to be wrapper functions of other open source software (FreeSurfer, ANTS,
FSL, etc.). These are the tools we are asking people to share.

**Sharing software tools is completely voluntary.** Investigators may
develop their own proprietary tools as part of their own research. We
hope these tools will be shared through collaborations but investigators
are not obligated to share these tools. We believe this will encourage
collaboration among our members but also provide investigators the
reassurance that they can protect their research.

##  Sharing Data with BIDS

TIC has adopted the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for easy
collaboration. BIDS provides a common directory structure storing
NeuroImaging data. Along with the data the BIDS structure contains JSON
files which contain additional information about the neuroimaging data,
which may be used as a quick reference.

BIDS has encouraged investigators to create BIDS Apps. These apps
provide a convenient and easy way for investigators to process their
data. TIC relies heavily on these Apps to do their processing. Each App
has their own little quirks. By identifying these quirks and sharing our
experience with how to run the software TIC members can get more down
with less effort.
