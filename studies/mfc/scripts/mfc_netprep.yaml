# YAML inputs explained:
# 
#  fmri          : filename of 4D BOLD NIFTI file
#
#  gm_probmap    : filename of gray matter probability map (GMPM). The fMRI NIFTI file and 
#                  GMPM file MUST be in the same space but they do not have to have the same
#                  dimensions. The GMPM will be transformed by ANTS into the same space 
#                  as the fMRI data.  The GMPM will also be converted into a GM mask according
#                  to the user specified threshold (gm_threshold).  If one already has a mask
#                  in the same space as the fMRI just enter it as the gm_probtissue and set
#                  the gm_threshold equal to 0.  
#        
#  gm_threshold  : Threshold to convert the GMPM to a mask. The mask will then be used in 
#                  nilearn's NIFTIMASKER.
#
#  The remaining set of inputs control how the correlation matrix is created with nilearn.
#  Links to nilearn are below. I have simply copied the appropriate documentation for 
#  each input parameter. 
#
#  nilearn_nifti_masker:
#
#      confounds:  A CSV filename containing a list of confounds to be removed from fMRI
#                  4D BOLD NIFTI file. The CSV file contains a header containing 
#                  a list of confounds. Each row corresponds to one volume of the fMRI
#                  4D BOLD NIFTI file.  For this reason, the number of rows in the 
#                  CSV file must equal the number of volumes in the 4D BOLD NIFTI file.
#                  While it is expected that users will be using a subset of the
#                  confounds created by fmriprep.  The user may add one or more additional
#                  confounds that were calculated by other means.  The easiest 
#                  way to work with CSV files on the command line is csvkit. 
#
#       kind : correlation 
#
#       standardize: boolean, optional. If standardize is True, the time-series are
#                    centered and normed: their mean is put to 0 and their variance 
#                    to 1 in the time dimension.
#
#       smoothing_fwhm : float, optional  If smoothing_fwhm is not None, it gives the
#                        full-width half maximum in millimeters of the spatial 
#                        smoothing to apply to the signal.
#
#       detrend: boolean, optional. If detrending should be applied on timeseries 
#                (before confound removal)
#
#       low_pass: None or float, optional. low cutoff frequency for filtering the fMRI
#                bold signal, in Hertz.  
#
#       high_pass: None or float, optional. high cutoff frequency for filtering the
#                 fMRI bold signal, in Hertz.  
#
#       t_r: float, Repetition time, in second (sampling period). This parameter must
#                   be defined if lowpass or highpass are defined.
#
# netprep.py Outputs explained:
#  
#   The netprep workflow takes a 4D fMRI NIFTI file and performs basic preprocessing to
#   prepare the time series for network analysis.  It will also calculate the correlation
#   matrices before and after the confounds have been regressed out. 
#
#   gm_mask.nii.gz   : is the gray matter mask derived from the gray matter probability
#                      map.  The gm_mask is in the same space and dimensions of the 
#                      fMRI BOLD NIFTI file.  
#
#   preproc_mean.nii.gz  : is the mean of the fMRI BOLD 4D file. 
#
#   fmri_confounds_kept.nii.gz  :  fMRI BOLD 4D file before confound regression. All other 
#                                  methods of preprocessing have been applied as selected
#                                  by the user. Detrending low-pass filtering, high-pass
#                                  filtering, standardizing, and smoothing. 
#
#   fmri_confounds_kept_correlation_matrix.mat :  Correlation matrix of fmri_confounds_bold.nii.gz
#                                                 stored as a Matlab mat file.
#
#   fmri_confounds_removed.nii.gz  - fMRI BOLD 4D file after regression. Processing is identical
#                                    to fmri_confounds_kept.nii.gz with the addition of the 
#                                    confounds being regressed out of the signal.
#
#   fmri_confounds_removed_correlation_matrix.mat : Correlation matrix of 
#                                                   fmri_confounds_removed.nii.gz stored as a 
#                                                   Matlab mat file. 
#
#   correlation_histogram_comparison.png :  This is a png file that plots the histograms
#                                           of the correlation matrices before and after
#                                           confound regression.
